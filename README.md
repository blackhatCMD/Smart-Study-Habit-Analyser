## 🎯 Solution

This project implements a **basic Python study tracker** that does the following:

1. Takes input for each study session  
2. Stores data in a list of dictionaries  
3. Processes the data to extract insights  
4. Displays a summary report and recommendations  

It demonstrates understanding of:

- Functions  
- Data structures  
- Loops  
- Conditionals  
- Basic I/O  
- Simple analytics
