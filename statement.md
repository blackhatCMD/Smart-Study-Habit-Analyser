# Project Statement  
## Smart Study Habit Analyzer

---

## 1. Problem Statement
Students often study daily without tracking how much time they spend or how consistent they are.  
Without measurable data, they cannot understand:
- Whether they are improving,
- Which days they are most productive,
- How long their average sessions are,
- Or how consistent their study routine is.

This leads to ineffective study patterns and difficulty in self-improvement.

## 2. Scope of the Project
This project focuses on building a simple Python-based tool that:
- Records study sessions (subject + duration)
- Automatically logs the date
- Analyzes the recorded data to generate insights
- Provides recommendations to improve study habits

The project stays within the limits of basic Python programming and avoids external libraries to keep the solution simple and beginner-friendly.

Out of scope:
- Long-term data storage
- Visual graphs or dashboards
- Advanced machine-learning based predictions
